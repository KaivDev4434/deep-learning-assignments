" Give me liberty or give me death . "
Some people gained weight , some people didn't gain weight .

As I set out to understand depression , and to interview people who had experienced it , I found that there were people who seemed , on the surface , to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it .
He wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery , and he said , " My father sent me two presents this year , First , a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image that I didn't really need , but I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that I'm living on my own and have a job I seem to love .

Finally , Richard Feynman , famous physicist , once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization , that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but repel each other when they're close together .
Isn't it time that we develop this concept of a duty of care and extended it to include a care for our shared but increasingly endangered democratic values ?
Any place you see a differential , there're some interesting questions . There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff . But again , coal . Maybe the same stuff , maybe the same system , maybe bioenergy , and you're applying exactly the same technology .
I noticed that , despite all the efforts , there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals .
They're often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap .
I would have that hard conversation .
It's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying .

CR: I don't know if we can do this , but we've got the image of the cat .
It is a critical and common part of the world around us , and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators , and more excitingly , they're starting to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts .
They have as much control over their own fates as my car .
We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain , including those involved in sexual arousal .
It didn't look all that special from the outside , as I said , but when we walked inside , I was immediately struck by three things: First of all , it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside .
It was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before , so I asked my dad , " When was this built ? "
This will start with the HOV lanes and move from there .
So when this is fully developed and for human use , persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone , but actually feel like flesh and bone .
Let's build her a bionic limb , to enable her to go back to her life of dance .
Turns out ants are pretty good at this .
Every day , I am so grateful because I am a woman .
Geena Rocero: Sure . Well , first , really , I'm so blessed .

These causes have been a bit invisible .
BG: Yeah , well people can take , there is some aid that was wellmeaning and didn't go well .
BG: Well , I'd say overall the kids get a great education , but you've got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they're going to go and do , and our philosophy has been to be very clear with them most of the money's going to the foundation and help them find something they're excited about .

But to come back , where I am at the animal species , there is things to see .
There is things to see , there is the big challenge .

And so recycling the material requires an enormous amount of heat , because think about it: CO2 is so dilute in the air , that material is binding it really strong , and so you need a lot of heat in order to recycle the material .
These are not large enough to solve our climate crisis , and so what we need to do is we need to actually think about what it could take .
And I find myself amazed by the lifesaving work that he and his colleagues do each and every day .
Now you're seeing it deploy .
My instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight , because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit , and as I said , type is very adaptable .
So I thought , well , a decade , that's not bad , that's more than a stopgap .
Now in fission , you take a big nucleus , you break it in part , in two , and it makes lots of energy , and this is how the nuclear reactor today works .
Now , so the first thing I did is I looked into the literature and I see , how does fusion work ?
So the physicists have been working on fusion for a while , and one of the ways they do it is with something called a tokamak .
Now , that's not quite good enough , because the laser to put that energy in was more energy than that , but it was pretty good .
Unfortunately , it doesn't last quite long enough , so we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit , but last month it got a lot better , so I think we have the plasma compressing now .
The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes ?
Here's one house with the sacred altar , here's the house of houses , the family enclosure , with the humans here where the sacred altar would be , and then here's the village as a whole a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here , the chief's immediate family here , and here there's a tiny village only this big .
And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village , right ?
And finally , well , isn't this just intuition ?

The general point is there are probably hundreds and thousands of applications of this data , I've mentioned a few , but there's others: deforestation , the ice caps melting .
We want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data .
It bombed , and I was fine .
In color images , every pixel is represented by three binary sequences that correspond to the primary colors .
The harp has four separate pendulums , and each pendulum has 11 strings , so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes , and the harps are all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the music .
Yet both of these boys have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder .
And we are going to put the device in the other office , behind the wall , and we are going to monitor him as he moves .
So it's not just radar .
You're going to fry them like if they were in a microwave .
Listen to it again .
Okay , and what we're looking at here , this is Sam's optic nerve , which is a direct extension of her brain , so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there .
Can we change things that affect air pollution and climate at the same time ?
I've discovered I can do my own hair .
Okay , next question .
I'm going to try to square some threedigit numbers this time .
You have a sevendigit number , call out any six of them please .
Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born ?
Call out a single digit that will be the fivedigit number that I will try to square , go ahead .
She was an unbelievable role model .

It's sort of circling around the number you're trying to get .
So an ant outside foraging , searching for seeds in the hot sun , just loses water into the air .
So here's an example of ant security .
There are many different kinds of cancer .
So if you think from the perspective of early metastatic cancer cells as they're out searching around for the resources that they need , if those resources are clustered , they're likely to use interactions for recruitment , and if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting , then maybe we could set traps to catch them before they become established .
So let's take a look at the reaction of the industry and the regulators and the prosecutors to these clear early warnings that could have prevented the crisis .
Except for around the two towers , there is 32 inches of steel paralleling the bridge .
Well one day , curiosity got the better of Pandora , and she did open the box .
I'm still pretty numb , but noticing more moments of really realizing Mike isn't coming home .

The baby remains sleeping , showing no interest at all .
When we do things that produce biodiversity , we actually get more abundance , and that's important so that we can feed people .
We know that we can produce healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people that don't use the land , that don't use much water , have a low carbon footprint , and are costeffective .
The specific sound of a speaking voice is the result of many anatomical variables , but it’s mostly determined by the age and health of our vocal cords and the size of our larynxes .
People extol a difference only because it's theirs .
We're living now in an age of what scientists have started to call " conservation reliance , " and what that term means is that we've disrupted so much that nature can't possibly stand on its own anymore , and most endangered species are only going to survive if we stay out there in the landscape riggging the world around them in their favor .
That determines good teams from bad .
He comes back and instead of deciding that , well , now since I've lost my leg , that second dream is over , he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball , and he starts this group called VETSports , which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing .

My 300 million modules in my neocortex isn't going to cut it .
It's a quantitative expansion of neocortex , but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap and invent language and art and science and technology and TED conferences .
And that quote , " The only disability in life is a bad attitude , " the reason that that's bullshit is because it's just not true , because of the social model of disability .
They wanted to unravel the mystery of her design .
In true TED fashion , here is my most embarrassing picture .
